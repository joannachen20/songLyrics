We used to try to shake it up
We never listened to the sound of silence
We used to sleep under the sun
We never did it if it made us violent
It's hard to recognise the things we have in our life
Until they're - we don't know
We used to run under the stars
Now we can see them in the sky above us
I didn't feel the change
But 17 seems to far away
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
I wish we could go back to when we were younger
Nothing could touch us
Can see the mountains
Nothing seems the same
I wish that we had never changed
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
We used to ? between the floors
But It's hard to hold em when we're holding nothing
It's like a film we can't replay
Too hard to hear the lines and we are saying
Oh God we have changed
Now all that we can do is walk away
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
I wish we could go back to when we were younger
Nothing could touch us
Can see the mountains
Nothing seems the same
I wish that we had never changed
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
I wish we could go back to when we were younger
Nothing could touch us
Can see the mountains
Nothing seems the same
I wish that we had never changed
I wish we could go back to when we were children
Running in circles
In glass houses
Glass houses
Glass houses
